## FiniteLoop Search Engine ##
##--------------------------##

This is the source code that make up the FiniteLoop Search Engine. The
contents of this distribution are:
        The INPUT folder is the cache location for documents to be ingest
        and processed. The control folder contains the control document
        group, based on the TF-IDF quiz for EECS 767, Information
        Retrieval (Spring 2018). The cached_docs folder is where the niche
        crawler stores the seen web pages, this folder is created by the
        Makefile if it doesn't exist (via `make prepenv`)
        -----------------------------------
        INPUT
                cached_docs
                control
                        test1.txt
                        test2.txt
                        test3.txt
                        test4.txt
        The OUTPUT folder is the location where the ingest (pre-processing)
        and procesing modules store the shelve data for inter-module data
        sharing. The CACHE folder is the location where the text summary
        data is stored - one database file per cached document. Both of
        these directories are created by the Makefile if they don't exist
        (via `make prepenv`)

                CACHE
        The cgi-bin comes with the search.cgi script, which provides the
        HMI for user interaction via a browser, hosted on a webserver. The
        Makefile copies all of the relevant folders and files into this
        directory in preparation for web serving. The folder is subsequently
        copied to the users public_html/cgi-bin directory and permissions
        are set accordingly - Makefile is currently tailored for the EECS
        people.eecs.ku.edu server (via `make webprep`). Invokes the query
        module.

        The src folder contains the source code for the FiniteLoop Search
        Engine. Each with its own purpose
        -----------------------------------
        src
                html_summary.py - reads contents of folder and creates summary
                        text files
                processing.py   - python script to process ingest.py file output
                runhtml.sh      - wrapping process to fork separate instances
                        of the htm_summary.py script in order to optimize
                        summary file geneation on a single machine
                web_crawler.py  - python script to perfom niche crawler - 
                        configured to crawl iso.org
                ingest.py	- python script to pre-process control and
                        and cached documents
                query.py	- python script to perform queries against
                        the processing output database files (invoked by
                        the search script)
                seeShelve.py    - python script to expose the contents of 
                        shelve database files
                updateDB.py     - python script for re-writing shelve file

##------------##
## To INSTALL ##
##------------##
## Prepare the distro and environment
FiniteLoopSE$ make prepenv
        
## Can either crawl
FiniteLoopSE$ make crawl
## Or use pre-crawled data, available at:
##  https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~terrapin/data/cached_docs-20180417-10m.tar.gz
##  https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~terrapin/data/cached_docs-20180417-30min.tar.gz
##  https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~terrapin/data/cached_docs-20180413-90m.tar.gz
FiniteLoopSE$ cd INPUT
FiniteLoopSE$ tar -zxvf cached_docs-20180417-10m.tar.gz

## Ingest the documents
FiniteLoopSE$ make ingest

## Process the documents
FiniteLoopSE$ make process

## Can either create summary cache files
FiniteLoopSE$ make html
## Or use pre-cached data, available at:
##  https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~terrapin/data/CACHE-10m.tar.gz		 
##  https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~terrapin/data/CACHE-30min.tar.gz		 
##Transfer to web area
FiniteLoopSE$ make webprep

## In the event that URLs are not being rendered, or an erro in reading the
## download_manifest file by ingest.py (make ingest), it may be necessary
## to 'clean up' the database files
FiniteLoopSE$ python3 src/updateDB.py origFile newFile

## Helper Functions
## To see the contents of the OUTPUT directory shelve files
FiniteLoopSE$ make seedata
## To see a specific file
FiniteLoopSE$ python3 src/seeShelve.py fileName

## To clean up the directories (including public_html) from the installation
## of the search engine (uninstall)
make clean

## To run the query module as a standalone (outputs results in 
## OUTPUT/query(.db))
make query
## To run search.cgi module independent of a browser
python3 cgi-bin/search.cgi 
## (expects that make webprep or similar functions have occurred)
